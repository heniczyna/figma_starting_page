Based on: [The Figma 2021 Crash Course by Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu1so3pz4bA)

This is first attempt to work with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), tool for designing user interface.
* create your [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) account and login
* useful link [UI Goodies](http://www.uigoodies.com/)
  * background used [UI Goodies](http://www.uigoodies.com/) -> Patterns and backgrounds -> Subtle Patterns which leads to [this site](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/?ref=uigoodies.com) -> [Greek Vase Pattern](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/greek-vase-pattern/)
* Figma plugins installed: Iconify, Lorem ipsum, Unsplash
* no local copy of the repo

First/landing page of the design:

Seems that relative links also work:
