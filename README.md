Based on: [The Figma 2021 Crash Course by Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu1so3pz4bA)

This is first attempt to work with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), tool for designing user interface.
* create your [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) account and login
* useful link [UI Goodies](http://www.uigoodies.com/)
  * background used [UI Goodies](http://www.uigoodies.com/) -> Patterns and backgrounds -> Subtle Patterns which leads to [this site](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/?ref=uigoodies.com) -> [Greek Vase Pattern](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/greek-vase-pattern/)
  * hero image -> in the tutorial it has been downloaded [Storefront Illustration](https://lukaszadam.com/illustrations?ref=uigoodies.com), however seems something has changed and there is no option to download this particular illustration (tutorial shows that it is possible to download this as zip file with `svg` file), there is only button saying `Download FREE Right Here` which redirects to [here](https://lukaszadam.gumroad.com/l/pBPJg) and requires some email address
    * when `svg` file has been unzipped, then he just drag-and-dropped from Desktop to Figma canvas and it appears as `Asset` 
* Figma plugins installed: Iconify, Lorem ipsum, Unsplash
* import ***1_design.fig*** to your account and explore the project, therefore:
  * download ***1_design.fig*** to your local disc drive,
  * after logging-in to Figma you will see **Import** icon in the upper right corner of the page, so hit it and choose the downloaded ***1_design.fig***,
  * that's all, should work straight away
* no local copy of the repo

First/landing page of the design:

Seems that relative links also work:
